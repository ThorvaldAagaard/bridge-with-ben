PyGame implementation of a bridge application

Currently just testing if it can play in a browser using pygbag

Major setback as tensorflow is not available in pygbag, and still haven't checked the DLL for DS can run i pygbag

The implementation is with https://github.com/lucek3332/bridge-pygame used as a starting point for the pygame-implementation, and https://github.com/lorserker/ben as the robot-players.

To play just clone this repository and switch to directory game and execute

```python main.py```
